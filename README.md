# Autoviz EDU
 A tool to use as a first step of explority data analysis 
 
 It works by creating a datafame with the data you would like to analyse, then using the AutoViz package it generates visualizations. 

More infomration on how to use the package can be found on https://pypi.org/project/autoviz/ however the source code in main should be sufficent to generate visualizations by just specifying 2 things, 

 1. the file path of the  data
 2. where the visualizations should be saved

This wil allow you to generate visualtions in Under 5 minuites. Natrually with code so simple, you loose the ability to customize. This tool is intended to help you get familiar with the data by creating visulaizations in under 5 minutes.
